    "**Introduction to the Penetration Tester Path**\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is an introduction to the Penetration Tester Job Role Path and a general introduction to Penetration Tests and each of the phases that we cover in-depth throughout the modules. We recommend starting the path with this module and referring to it periodically as you complete other modules to see how each topic area fits in the bigger picture of the penetration testing process. This module is also a great starting point for anyone new to HTB Academy or the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "This path is intended for aspiring penetration testers from all walks of life and experienced pen testers looking to upskill in a particular area, become more well-rounded or learn things from a different perspective. This path covers core concepts necessary to succeed at External Penetration Tests, Internal Penetration Tests (both network and Active Directory), and Web Application Security Assessments. Through each module, we dive deep into the specialized techniques, methodologies, and tools needed to succeed in a penetration testing role. The path takes students on a highly hands-on journey through all stages of a penetration test, from reconnaissance and enumeration to documentation and reporting, culminating with a simulated penetration test capstone module. Students who complete this path in its entirety will be armed with the practical skills and mindset necessary to perform professional security assessments against real-world networks at a basic to intermediate level. Each of our modules dives deep into the \"why\" behind the issues and tactics that we present and is not just a tutorial on running point-and-click tools. We weave in stories and scenarios from our real-world experience performing security assessments for clients in all verticals and local and federal government."
